  <h2>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h2>
 <p> The combined experience I have working at the top fortune 500 companies has allowed me to develop a skillset that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business

 <br />I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young minds about how to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.

 </p><p>As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's holding you back is yourself.

 <br />A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.

 <br />"how big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn't fail?"
<br />You've already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're passionate about.

 <br />I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your company.
